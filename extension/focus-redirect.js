/**
 * focus-redirect.js — new-tab focus workaround
 *
 * Chrome's documented behavior: when the user creates a NEW tab (Ctrl+T), the
 * address bar always receives focus first, and a new-tab override page cannot
 * reliably claim it. Refreshing or navigating to the same page does NOT trigger
 * that behavior, which is why a plain focus() call works after a reload but
 * not after Ctrl+T.
 *
 * The community-verified workaround (Stack Overflow 16684663) is to force one
 * self-navigation: loading the page with a `?focus=1` query makes it a
 * navigated page instead of a freshly-created new-tab page, after which Chrome
 * no longer pins focus to the address bar and focus() (or the autofocus
 * attribute) takes effect.
 *
 * This script must be the FIRST script in <head> so the redirect happens
 * before any dashboard logic runs. It is intentionally small and dependency
 * free. location.replace() starts an immediate navigation; the current page is
 * torn down before later scripts meaningfully run.
